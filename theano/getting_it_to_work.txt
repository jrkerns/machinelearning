I'm not sure what eventually happened to get Theano to use my GPU, but here are my current settings and helpful tips:

.theanorc.txt


[global]
device = gpu
floatX = float32
cxx = D:\TDM-GCC-64\bin\g++.exe

[cuda]
root = C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v7.5

[nvcc]
fastmath = True
# flags = --use-local-env --cl-version=2013
compile_bindir = D:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin  <- VC12 == 2013


For a while, this didn't work, but may have been due a cache error. Clearing the cache should be able to be done via:
theano-cache clear
but I never got it to work. You can manually clear it at:
D:\Users\James\AppData\Local\Theano

After that things were intermittent, but seems to be somewhat stable.

One other thing. I tried debugging the failing nvcc complile by running python in a shell and importing theano.sandbox.cuda.nvcc_compiler
and it started working. Don't know if this was a trigger or what.
Relevant system PATH variables and their order:
D:\TDM-GCC-64\bin;
D:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools\;
D:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin\amd64;  <- 64-bit
D:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin;        <- 32-bit
D:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\;
